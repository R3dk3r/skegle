          <p>Banjo-Kazooie is a single-player platform game where the player controls the protagonists Banjo and Kazooie from a third-person perspective. The game is split into nine levels where the player must gather musical notes and jigsaw pieces, called "Jiggies", to progress.[1] Players transit from one level to another through Gruntilda's lair, which acts as the game's central overworld. Jiggies allow the player to complete jigsaw puzzles which open doors to new levels, while musical notes grant players access to new inner sections of the overworld.[1] Like in Super Mario 64, the gameplay of Banjo-Kazooie is very open and allows the player to collect Jiggies and musical notes in a nonlinear order.[2][3] It is also possible to skip certain levels as long as the player has enough of these items to reach a farther one.[2]
Each level is composed of a number of challenges that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents.[1] The game also features some elements of action-adventure games. Players often have to speak with NPCs and then figure out a way to help them.[3] It is also possible to increase Banjo and Kazooie's energy bar by collecting extra honeycombs that are hidden throughout the levels.[1] Banjo and Kazooie can perform a wide range of abilities, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies.[1] Most of these moves are learned by finding Bottles, a friendly mole, inside the worlds. Some moves require specific items so that they can be performed. For instance, red feathers allow Banjo and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers protect them from damage.[1] Some items also allow the character to gain temporary abilities in a particular moment. For instance, the turbo trainers provide a speed burst to reach a certain destination on time.[1]
Banjo and Kazooie are occasionally aided by their friend Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman who can use magical powers to transform them into several creatures like a termite, a pumpkin, a bee, a walrus, and a crocodile.[1] These transformations have their own special features and allow the player to access areas that were previously inaccessible. For instance, the walrus can resist the effects of icy-cold water. Mumbo Tokens that are scattered throughout the game allow the transformation process. The game also includes cheats that the player can unlock by finding Gruntilda's spellbook, Cheato.[1]
Plot[edit]
Banjo-Kazooie is set in the Spiral Mountain and follows the story of Banjo, a male brown honey bear, and Kazooie, a female red-crested Breegull who is always kept in Banjo's backpack. The game begins when a foul-tempered witch named Gruntilda learns from her cauldron Dingpot that Tooty, Banjo's younger sister, is more beautiful than her.[4] Jealous, Gruntilda creates a machine that can transfer a person's level of beauty to another, which she intends to use with Tooty.[5] She then abducts Tooty from Banjo's house while he is sleeping.[6] In response to the kidnapping, Kazooie wakes Banjo up and the two set out to rescue her. Banjo and Kazooie learn from Tooty's friend, Bottles the mole, that she was captured by Gruntilda and suggests they need some training to collect musical notes and jigsaw pieces to progress through Gruntilda's lair. Along the way, they are aided by Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman and Gruntilda's former teacher.[7]
By the time most of the musical notes and jiggies are gathered, Banjo and Kazooie face Gruntilda in a trivia game show named "Grunty's Furnace Fun". The game presents questions and challenges related to certain aspects of the game. After going through several game boards, the two win the game and Gruntilda flees. Reunited with Tooty, Banjo and Kazooie return home and celebrate their victory with their friends and a barbecue. However, Tooty reminds everyone that Gruntilda has fled and orders Banjo and Kazooie to defeat her.[8] The duo returns to Gruntilda's lair and reach the top of the tower, where they face a battle with Gruntilda. With the help of some friendly creatures called Jinjos, Banjo and Kazooie defeat Gruntilda, trapping her underneath a boulder. Returning to their home, Banjo and Kazooie go on vacation at a beach with their friends and celebrate their victory. The game ends with Gruntilda swearing revenge against Banjo and Kazooie and calling for her henchman Klungo to move the boulder that is covering her.[9]
Development[edit]
Banjo-Kazooie was developed by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles.[10] The game evolved from Project Dream, a cancelled adventure game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that was being developed by Rare's Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest team.[10] Project Dream used Rare's ACM (Advanced Computer Modeling) graphics technology, first used in Donkey Kong Country, to a very advanced level and was originally intended to star a boy named Edison who would own a wooden sword and get into trouble with a group of pirates. However, as development of the game continued, Edison was replaced by a rabbit and later a bear, who became Banjo.[10] Although the project was in development for more than one year, it was ultimately cancelled with the introduction of the Nintendo 64, which made the ACM technology obsolete.[10]
Actual work on Banjo-Kazooie started in March 1997 with a development team of 10 people.[10][11] However, as development progressed, the team grew to a total of 15 members, which included seven engineers, five artists, two designers and one musician.[10] The team was composed of both experienced and inexperienced people; some had been working at Rare for 10 years while others had never previously worked on a video game.[11] The 3D world of Super Mario 64 was a major inspiration for Banjo-Kazooie, as Rare intended to combine it with the look of Donkey Kong Country.[11] The game was designed to appeal players of all ages in a similar vein to Walt Disney Animation Studios films. According to Rare, "We wanted the characters to primarily appeal to a younger audience but, at the same time, give them enough humour and attitude not to discourage older players."[11] The music of the game, composed by Grant Kirkhope,[12] was designed to gradually fade from one style to the next without pause, while the overall composition loops continuously.[3]
Rare decided to make an action-based game that focused totally on Banjo and his abilities. Kazooie was later conceived during the planning of such abilities.[10] According to Mayles, "We came up with the [...] idea that a pair of wings could appear from his backpack to help him perform a second jump. We also wanted Banjo to be able to run very fast when required [so] we added a pair of 'fast-running' legs that appeared from the bottom of the backpack. [And soon after] we came up with the logical conclusion that these could belong to another character, one that actually lived in Banjo's backpack."[10] The character was named after a kazoo, which was considered an annoying instrument, "much like the personality of the bird", Mayles explained.[10] Instead of actual dialogue, all the characters in the game feature "mumbling" voices. This choice was made to convey their personalities without them actually speaking, as Rare felt the actual speech "could ruin the player's perception of the characters."[10] The witch Gruntilda was inspired by Grotbags from the Grotbags British television series.[10]
Banjo-Kazooie employs a very advanced technique to render its graphics. The characters were created with minimal amounts of texturing to give them a sharp and clean look, while the backgrounds use very large textures split into 64Ã—64 pieces, which was the largest texture size the Nintendo 64 could render.[10] As a result, this technique caused significant memory fragmentation issues. However, the developers managed to create a proprietary system that could "reshuffle" memory as players played through the game to solve the fragmentation.[10] According to lead programmer Chris Sutherland, "I'd doubt many N64 games of the time did anything like that".[10] The fact that the player could be transformed into small creatures was implemented to give some of the worlds a different sense of scale.[10]
Rare originally planned to include a multiplayer mode and more worlds to the game, but these features were not implemented due to time constraints;[10][13] some of these would later be included in the sequel Banjo-Tooie instead.[14] In addition, a feature called "Stop 'N' Swop", which would have allowed data to be transferred between both Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, remains incomplete in the game.[10] The feature was never fully implemented due to technical difficulties in the Nintendo 64 hardware.[15] The actual development of the game took overall 17 months to complete after Rare discarded Project Dream, the first two of these being spent experimenting with Dream's graphic technology.[10] A working version of the game was shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in June 1997.[16] The game was initially scheduled for a release in late 1997, but was eventually delayed.[17] It was released on 29 June 1998 in North America and 17 July 1998 in Europe.[18]</p>
